this line contains *italics* and **bold** text.
this one has ***both***.
below this line, there will be a empty one.

now there is more text.

this should be \
one line.

there is also math: g^2^ \* v_1_
> and a quote
> with some extra text
and some `inline code`.
```
this is not inline
    and has no specified language
```
this separates both code blocks
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("ðŸ¦€");
}
```

this is ==highlighted== and ~~redacted~~.

we can list things here:
[ul
    - entry
    - other entry
    - multiline
      will appear as one
    - nested entry
    [ul
        - stuff
        - more stuff
    ]
]
and we can even do that in a order
[ol
    # entry
    # entry 2 [ol # did you know # you can define these # lists in a single # line this way ]
]
# and a heading
immediately followed by text
## and a subheading
aaaand we are done i think
[math
    $\a = \b$
]
(this isnt a link)

this is regular text. [ilmath $\a\n\d$] it continues here.
actually not done, jump [[here]] if you want to.
also extra text :3

we also support (links)[https://domain.invalid/index.php]!
