and some `inline code`.
```
this is not inline
    and has no specified language
```
this separates both code blocks
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("ðŸ¦€");
}
```

this is ==highlighted== and ~~redacted~~.

we can list things here:
[ul
    - entry
    - other entry
    - multiline
      will appear as one
    - nested entry
    [ul
        - stuff
        - more stuff
    ]
]
# and a heading
immediately followed by text
## and a subheading
aaaand we are done i think
