```
this is not inline
    and has no specified language
```
this separates both code blocks
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("ðŸ¦€");
}
```

this is ==highlighted== and ~~redacted~~.

we can list things here:
- thing
- thing
  - subthing
  - other text
    - very deep indent
- thing
  that spans multiple lines

# and a heading
immediately followed by text
## and a subheading
